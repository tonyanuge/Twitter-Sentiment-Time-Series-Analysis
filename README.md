 Twitter Sentiment Time Series Analysis and Big Data Processing

This repository contains projects aimed at analyzing the sentiment of tweets over time and processing large datasets using big data technologies. The analysis is performed using Python, and the workflows are documented in Jupyter Notebooks.

 Project Overview

 Twitter Sentiment Time Series Analysis

The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets and visualize the sentiment trends over time. This analysis can provide insights into public opinion and how it changes in response to events or over specific periods.

 Big Data Processing

This part of the project demonstrates how to handle and process large datasets using Apache Spark and MongoDB. It includes loading data from HDFS, transforming it, and saving it to MongoDB.

 Data

The dataset used in this project is a collection of tweets with the following structure:
 Tweet ID,
 Timestamp,
 User ID,
 Username,
 Tweet text

Note: The dataset file ProjectTweets.csv is too large to be stored directly in this repository. You can download it from [this link](https://linktoyourdataset.com/ProjectTweets.csv) and place it in the root directory of the repository.

 Key Components

 Twitter Sentiment Time Series Analysis

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
    Load the CSV file containing the tweets into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Inspect and clean the data as necessary.

2. Sentiment Analysis
    Apply sentiment analysis techniques to classify the tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
    Tools and libraries such as TextBlob or VADER can be used for this purpose.

3. Time Series Analysis
    Aggregate the sentiment data over specified time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
    Analyze the trends and patterns in the sentiment data over time.

4. Visualization
    Create visualizations to represent the sentiment trends over time.
    Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create plots and charts.

 Big Data Processing

1. Environment Setup
    Initialize a SparkSession with MongoDB configurations.

2. Data Loading
    Load the CSV file from HDFS into a Spark DataFrame.

3. Data Transformation
    Transform the data as needed using Spark's DataFrame API.

4. Data Storage
    Save the transformed data to MongoDB.

 Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

 ADA_TwitterSentiment_Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook documenting the sentiment analysis workflow.
 Big_Data_SA.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook demonstrating big data processing using Spark and MongoDB.
 download_data.py: A script to download the dataset from an external source.
 README.md: This README file providing an overview of the projects.

 Requirements

To run the code in these projects, you will need the following Python libraries:

 Pandas
 NumPy
 Matplotlib
 Seaborn
 TextBlob or VADER (for sentiment analysis)
 PySpark
 pymongo

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn textblob vaderSentiment pyspark pymongo


 Usage

To reproduce the analysis and big data processing, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset using the download_data.py script:
   bash
   python download_data.py
   
3. Ensure that the ProjectTweets.csv file is in the root directory of the repository.

 Sentiment Analysis

1. Open the ADA_TwitterSentiment_Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb notebook.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the sentiment analysis.

 Big Data Processing

1. Set up a Hadoop and MongoDB environment.
2. Open the Big_Data_SA.ipynb notebook.
3. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the big data processing.

 Results

The final output of the projects includes:
 Cleaned and preprocessed tweet data.
 Sentiment classification for each tweet.
 Visualizations showing sentiment trends over time.
 Transformed data stored in MongoDB.

 Conclusion

These projects provide frameworks for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data and processing large datasets using big data technologies. They can be adapted and extended for different datasets and use cases.
