Twitter Sentiment Time Series Analysis
This repository contains a project aimed at analyzing the sentiment of tweets over time. The analysis is performed using Python, and the workflow is documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets and visualize the sentiment trends over time. This analysis can provide insights into public opinion and how it changes in response to events or over specific periods.

Data
The dataset used in this project is a collection of tweets with the following structure:
Tweet ID
Timestamp
User ID
Query (if any)
Username
Tweet text
Key Components
The project consists of the following main steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load the CSV file containing the tweets into a Pandas DataFrame.
Inspect and clean the data as necessary.
Sentiment Analysis

Apply sentiment analysis techniques to classify the tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
Tools and libraries such as TextBlob or VADER can be used for this purpose.
Time Series Analysis

Aggregate the sentiment data over specified time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
Analyze the trends and patterns in the sentiment data over time.
Visualization

Create visualizations to represent the sentiment trends over time.
Use libraries Matplotlib or Seaborn to create plots and charts.
Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

ADA_TwitterSentiment_Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire workflow from data loading to visualization.
ProjectTweets.csv: The dataset containing the tweet.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
TextBlob or VADER (for sentiment analysis)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn textblob vaderSentiment
Usage
To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that the ProjectTweets.csv file is in the root directory of the repository.
Open the ADA_TwitterSentiment_Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb notebook.
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.
Results
The final output of the analysis includes:

Cleaned and preprocessed tweet data.
Sentiment classification for each tweet.
Visualizations showing sentiment trends over time.
Conclusion
This project provides a framework for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data and visualizing sentiment trends over time. It can be adapted and extended for different datasets and use cases.
